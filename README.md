# AzkarApp

The Azkar app provides Muslims with a collection of text to recite and read after prayers. It follows the MVVM design pattern to separate the concerns of data, UI, and business logic. Coroutines are used for handling asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth and responsive app behavior. Dagger-Hilt is employed for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies and promoting modular architecture. Room database is used to store data locally, allowing users to access Azkar even without an internet connection. The app utilizes a broadcast receiver to send timely notifications, ensuring users are reminded of the Azkar at the appropriate times. The app’s functionality is thoroughly tested using Android Unit and Component testing to ensure high quality and reliability.

– The app was built with:

MVVM as a design pattern.
Coroutine.
Dagger-Hilt.
Room database.
Android Unit & Component testing.
